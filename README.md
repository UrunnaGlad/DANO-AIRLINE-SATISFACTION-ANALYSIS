2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Checked for missing/null values and handled inconsistencies.  
   - Standardized categorical values (e.g., `Satisfied`, `Neutral or Dissatisfied`, `Class`, `Customer Type`).  
   - Verified numerical ranges for service rating columns (1‚Äì5).     

3. **Created Calculated Columns**  
   To enhance the analysis, the following columns and measures were created in Power BI:  
   - **Age Groups** ‚Üí Grouped passengers into age ranges (e.g.,0-12, 13-17, 18-40, 40-60, 60+)  
   - **Satisfaction Numeric** ‚Üí Converted satisfaction to numeric values (`Satisfied = 1`, `Neutral/Dissatisfied = 0`) for easier aggregation.
